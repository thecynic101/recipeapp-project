Preparation Time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
Vegetable oil, for frying
Instructions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, sugar, and baking powder.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract (if using).
Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth batter forms. Ensure there are no lumps.
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with vegetable oil.
Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake, spreading it slightly with the back of a spoon to form a circle.
Cook the pancakes for about 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through.
Remove the pancakes from the skillet and repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet as needed.
Serve the Nigerian pancakes warm with toppings such as honey, syrup, jam, or fresh fruit.
