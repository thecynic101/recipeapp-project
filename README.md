### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned a lot about arrays and objects in Javascript. Since I was not able to use APIs, I had to find a more creative way to build the project. 
also, before this project, I had not worked on creating HTML elements using JS. 

### Continued development

This was a really fun project to work with. I also like it beacuse it is something I can continue building on as there are quite a number of recipes in the Nigerian cuisine and I hope to add as many as possible in this project. Also, I used vanilla Js to build this project and research showed that I could use frameworks like Vue or React to make it easier. I hope to start working with frameworks as soon as possible.
