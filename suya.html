Preparation Time: 1 hour 30 minutes (Total), 1 hour (Preparation), 30 minutes (Cooking)
Ingredients:
1 lb beef sirloin or chicken breast, thinly sliced
Suya spice mix (groundnut powder, paprika, ginger, garlic, onion powder, cayenne pepper)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
Skewers, soaked in water
Sliced onions and tomatoes, for garnish
Suya spice mix, for serving
Instructions:
In a bowl, combine the sliced meat with the vegetable oil and generously coat with the Suya spice mix. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best flavor.
Thread the marinated meat slices onto the soaked skewers, alternating with slices of onions and tomatoes if desired.
Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush with oil to prevent sticking.
Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the meat is cooked through and has charred grill marks.
Remove the skewers from the grill and sprinkle with additional Suya spice mix before serving.
Serve hot as a flavorful and aromatic Nigerian street food snack.
Fun Fact: Suya is a popular West African street food, particularly in Nigeria, where it is enjoyed as a snack or appetizer. It is often sold by street vendors who grill the skewered meat over open flames and serve it with spicy Suya spice mix for dipping.
