Preparation Time: 2 hours (Total), 1 hour 30 minutes (Preparation), 30 minutes (Baking)
Ingredients:
For the Dough:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter or margarine, chilled and cubed
1/2 cup cold water
1 teaspoon salt
For the Filling:
1 lb ground beef or chicken
1 onion, finely chopped
2 carrots, finely diced
1 potato, peeled and finely diced
1/2 cup green peas
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup beef or chicken broth
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
Instructions:
Prepare the Dough:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.
Add the chilled cubed butter or margarine and use your fingertips to rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Gradually add cold water while mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough.
Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Prepare the Filling:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent.
Add ground beef or chicken to the skillet and cook until browned.
Stir in diced carrots, potatoes, and green peas. Cook for a few minutes until vegetables are slightly softened.
Sprinkle all-purpose flour over the meat and vegetable mixture and stir well to combine.
Pour in beef or chicken broth and cook until the mixture thickens slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let it cool.
Assemble and Bake:
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/4 inch thickness.
Use a round pastry cutter or glass to cut out circles of dough for the pie crusts.
Place a spoonful of the cooled meat and vegetable filling onto one half of each dough circle.
Fold the other half of the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Use a fork to crimp the edges and seal the pies.
Brush the tops of the pies with beaten egg for a shiny finish.
Place the assembled pies on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let the meat pies cool slightly before serving.
Fun Fact: Meat pie is a beloved snack in Nigeria, often enjoyed on the go or as a delicious appetizer. It is commonly found in bakeries, street food stalls, and served at parties and gatherings. The flaky crust filled with savory meat and vegetables makes it a satisfying treat for any occasion.
