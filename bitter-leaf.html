Preparation Time: 1 hour 30 minutes
Ingredients:
2 cups washed bitter leaves
2 cups assorted meats (such as beef, goat meat, and cow tripe), cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2 cup dried fish, cleaned and deboned
1/2 cup crayfish, ground
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons palm oil
2 tablespoons ground crayfish
2 scotch bonnet peppers (atarodo), chopped
2 tablespoons ground uziza seeds (optional)
Salt, to taste
Instructions:
In a large pot, combine the assorted meats, dried fish, chopped onion, and ground crayfish. Add enough water to cover the ingredients and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meats are tender.
While the meats are cooking, prepare the bitter leaves by washing them thoroughly to remove the bitterness. You may need to wash them several times, changing the water each time.
Once the meats are tender, add the washed bitter leaves to the pot and stir well to combine.
Add the palm oil, chopped scotch bonnet peppers, and ground uziza seeds (if using) to the pot. Stir to combine.
Allow the soup to simmer for another 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the bitter leaves are tender and the flavors are well combined.
Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt if necessary.
Serve the Bitter Leaf Soup hot with a side of pounded yam, fufu, or eba.
Bitter Leaf Soup, also known as Ofe Onugbu, is a traditional Nigerian soup made with bitter leaves and assorted meats. It has a slightly bitter taste that is balanced by the rich flavors of the meats and spices. Enjoy!
