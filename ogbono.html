Preparation Time: 1 hour
Ingredients:
1 cup ground ogbono seeds (also known as African mango seeds)
2 cups assorted meat (such as beef, tripe, and cow feet), cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2 cup dried fish, cleaned and deboned
1/2 cup crayfish, ground
1 onion, chopped
2 cups chopped spinach or bitter leaf (fresh or frozen)
2 tablespoons palm oil
4 cups beef or chicken broth
2 scotch bonnet peppers (atarodo), chopped
Salt and pepper, to taste
Instructions:
Heat the palm oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add the chopped onions and saut√© until translucent.
Stir in the ground ogbono seeds and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
Pour in the beef or chicken broth and stir well to combine.
Add the assorted meat, dried fish, and ground crayfish to the pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cover the pot and let the soup simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the meat is tender.
Once the meat is cooked, stir in the chopped spinach or bitter leaf and chopped scotch bonnet peppers.
Allow the soup to simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are wilted and the flavors are well combined.
Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Serve the Ogbono Soup hot with a side of pounded yam, fufu, or rice.
